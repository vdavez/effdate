    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Under <a href="http://dccode.org/browser/#/1/1-206.02">section 602(c)Â of the Home Rule Act</a>, most Council acts** must be transmitted to Congress for 30-day passive review. In 40 years of Home Rule, there have only been 3 instances where Congress has exercised its power under section 602(c) to disapprove of Council acts.</p><p>Making matters worse, Congress decided that 30 days would be too easy to calculate, so Congress defined the 30-day period as follows:
    </p><blockquote><p>the 30-calendar-day period (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, and any day on which neither House is in session because of an adjournment sine die, a recess of more than 3 days, or an adjournment of more than 3 days) beginning on the day such act is transmitted by the Chairman to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate</p></blockquote>
    <p>Until now, calculating the 30-day period required reference to several calendars and hand counts. This counter actually computes the proper date with one caveat: it is only accurate retrospectively... </p>
    <p>That is because we can't actually know when Congress will be in recess (or not) before they go in recess (or don't). So, to write a program to let the public know when a bill actually would become a law would require a change in the Home Rule Act.</p>
    <p>** The main exceptions are (1) acts affecting the criminal code, which have 60-day periods, and (2) Charter amendments, which have a 35-day count (though the counting method is slightly different).</p>
